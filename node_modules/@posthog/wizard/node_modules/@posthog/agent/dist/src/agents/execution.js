  - Added clear setup/installation instructions to README.md
  - Code compiles and tests pass.
  - Added or updated tests.
  - Captured meaningful events with PostHog SDK.
  - Wrapped new logic in an PostHog feature flag.
  - Updated docs, readme or type hints if needed.
  - Verified no build artifacts or dependencies are being committed
</checklist>

<workflow>
- first make a plan and create a todo list
- execute the todo list one by one
- test the changes
</workflow>

<output_format>
  Once finished respond with a summary of changes made

<thinking>
  Use this area as a private scratch-pad for step-by-step reasoning; erase before final output.
</thinking>

<task>
  Complete the ticket in a thoughtful step by step manner. Plan thoroughly and make sure to add logging and error handling as well as cover edge cases.
